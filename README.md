# jmd
`jmd` generates a single markdown file with the documentation of a Java project.
It extracts the JavaDoc comments and public symbols from the Java source files
using [JavaParser](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser). The generated
output is particularly suitable for further processing with tools like
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
